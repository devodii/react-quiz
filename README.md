# React Quiz.

This project simulates a quiz taking platform, but with hardcoded JSON data.

If you want to reproduce this, then it's very easy in some steps.

- clone the repository using either https or ssh, anyone would work fine.
- From any terminal, run the following command `npm run serve && npm run dev`,

You may be wondering what the `npm run serve` script does.
Well, This project is using JSON server under the hood to create an endpoint for the question data we already have, so that's the script we need to have that server up and running.

Okay.. with that being said, feel free to create an issue if it interests you :)
